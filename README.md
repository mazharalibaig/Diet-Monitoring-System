# Diet-Monitoring-System
Arduino Sketch of our college project based on collecting data of an object (food intake of an animal in our case) and creating a data map of its food intake so as to analyze it with that of an ideal object and draw conclusions based on its food cycle incase of ilness'.

The project aims to create a datamap of the daily food intake of an animal and analyze it's food pattern based on its daily intake and then compare it with the ideal intake of that animal's breed. This is done inorder to pred-ict the reason behind the illness/abnormal behavior of an animal based on its recent food activity. The animal taken into consideration for our project was a cow since it was one of the most prominent domestic animals in India.
